### **Flat Earth Proof: A Token for Decentralizing Truth**

**Abstract**. Flat Earth Proof (sym. PROOF) is an ERC20 token on Ethereum blockchain. It is project that does not promise (much less guarantee) a return on investment (ROI). Indeed one would be hard pressed to even call it an investment. It is a more akin to a community based token (or currency) representing humanity's awakening to the truths that have always been present but that have been hidden--sometimes in plain sight! PROOF is a marriage of two movements in our current zeitgeist: the movement toward decentralization and the truth movement. PROOF is a tangible concept which shows how these two movements can go hand in hand.

**Introduction.** In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto sparked the decentralization movement when he published the Bitcoin white paper in the fall of 2008 and mined the first block in the bitcoin blockchain a few months later. In the white paper he described how his peer to peer electronic cash system would create a trustless environment where trusting 3rd parties to verify and confirm transactions would no longer be necessary. Human fallibility, biases, agendas, politics, laws and regulation, would no longer prevent two parties from transacting with each other. Essentially Satoshi created agnostic software which anyone with a pc and internet connection can run thereby decentralizing the functions of payment and monetary system away from centralized organizations like central banks and commercial banks. This was huge through in monetary history in that it took the power of money creation from the rich and powerful. 

The central problem for Satoshi was trust. He wrote, "The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically...We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts." We can gather he did not trust central banks, politicians, and indeed humans from corrupting the monetary system. There is certainly enough evidence to show his distrust of central banks was well founded. Clearly they have mismanaged the monetary system to the point we have constant boom and bust cycles and most of the major currencies have lost more than 90% of their initial purchasing power since their inception. Most economists do not refer this to as a loss of purchasing power but as natural rise in the cost of living as economies expand and GDP rises, which they simply call “inflation.” 

Satoshi's brilliant technological innovation to remove trust from money creation and money transfer is known as Bitcoin but at the core of bitcoin is technology known as blockchain. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology which allows for the transfer of value or important data without 3rd party intervention. 

We believe that the blockchain can also solve other pressing issues besides money. Currently people have serious trust issues with the media and the education system as terms such as conspiracy theories, hoaxes, and of course fake news become part of daily discourse. Tech companies have been accused of censoring certain viewpoints and shadow banning certain content producers whose viewpoints are deemed offensive, which often just means do not fit a certain narrow narrative. We’re not sure what to believe anymore.

**II. Flat Earth Proof**

Whereas Bitcoin attempts to disintermediate the power of money creation from central banks and power of money transfer from banks and other payment services, Flat Earth Proof attempts to disintermediate truth from the hallowed halls and ivory towers of education and the establishment media. For too long education and information has been too centralized and controlled by the so-called elite who stand to benefit from the population being programmed to see the world in certain way; a way that doesn’t threaten the ruling class. The ruling class will always game the system for their own benefit. 

While Satoshi argued that central banks have become purveyors of a false money (fiat currency) backed by nothing but propaganda. We argue that central authorities have become also purveyors of a false doctrine. Who are the these people you may ask? Some have given specific names such the Illuminati, Jesuits, Freemasons, other secret societies. The name does not particularly matter as they make up the Ruling Class or the so-called less than 1%, who wish to steer humanity in a certain direction. We would argue that direction is away from Truth. 

It is not hard to see that the modern world is full of degradation and descending further and further into depravity, It is mostly an empty nihilistic existence without any spiritual meaning. It seems our existence consists merely to be born to be slaves to an invisible master who controls us through the a sophisticated system of distraction, disinformation, temptation, material goods, and money. 

**III. Making Truth Great Again**

Flat Earth Proof is a community based token of like minded people who share a similar ideas of Truth and disintermediation of knowledge and information. For too long the Ruling Class through its control of printing press, education, and science, and now the mass media has had a monopoly on Truth. We aim to take control away from the Controllers. 

Before the “scientific revolution” of Copernicus, Newton, and Darwin, most of the world believed the world was a stationary flat plane. They took that fact for granted because there was to no clear evidence earth was anything but flat. The idea that a complicated biosphere could somehow form into a perfect round shaped globe with massive amounts of water curving and clinging to the surface of the earth seemed preposterous.
